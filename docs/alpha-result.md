# Alpha result ledger

**Long-lived record of every QuantConnect run.** Rejected, inconclusive,
invalidated, stale and unavailable results are kept here permanently. An
unfavourable result is never deleted and never silently replaced by a
rerun; a rerun is a new entry that references the one it supersedes.

Nothing in this file is trading authorization. QuantConnect is historical
replication only; Alpaca Paper is a later, separate forward-validation
stage.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| VALID | Ran on reviewed code, complete output, statistics usable |
| INVALIDATED | Ran, but a defect found afterwards makes the numbers unusable |
| REFUSED | The algorithm declined to emit results; no statistics exist |
| UNANALYSED | Complete raw output exists, but controlled analysis has not been run |
| PENDING_REVIEW | Output came from code that had not completed the review gate; unusable |
| PROVENANCE_INCOMPLETE | Run identity cannot be tied completely to reviewed source and artifacts |
| INCONCLUSIVE | Complete output, but the design cannot answer the question |
| STALE | Superseded by a later run on corrected code |
| UNAVAILABLE | Could not be run |

## Cumulative look accounting

Method V2 section 1.10 counts every real-market cloud execution, even when it
refuses, is never locally analysed, or ran accidentally. At this ledger's
opening there are **five additional run-level looks**: R-001, both R-002
runs, R-003, and R-004. The emitted alpha-cell exposure is **80**: 40 short-
horizon cells across A/B plus 40 monthly cells from the accidental A run.
R-001 emitted zero cells but still consumed a run; R-004 is a benchmark run,
not an alpha cell. Together with the prior 348 declared cells, the conservative
lifetime alpha-cell exposure floor is **428**. These counts do not make any
result valid and do not authorize analysis outside the reviewed workflow.

## R-001 — Monthly battery, Universe B_core, corrected code (REFUSED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | Monthly battery: MOM_3/6/9/12_1, RESIDUAL_MOM_6/12_1, GROSS_PROFITABILITY, QUALITY_COMPOSITE, QUALITY_MOMENTUM, MULTI_ALPHA_COMPOSITE |
| **Replication or new** | Exact replication of the frozen 2026-08-16 pre-registration, on corrected code |
| **Research look** | Counted real-market run; zero emitted alpha cells |

### What happened

The algorithm refused to emit:

```
INCOMPLETE|missing_specs=MULTI_ALPHA_COMPOSITE|RESIDUAL_MOM_12_1|RESIDUAL_MOM_6_1
```

Codex's completeness guard worked as designed. Rather than emit seven of
ten specifications as though the series were whole — which the previous
generation of this code did, and which produced a headline — it declined
to emit anything.

Universe construction itself was sound and matches the earlier run
exactly: `cap_rows=312696 cap_fallback=35268 cap_missing=7291`. The run
processed 31,958,444 data points in 4,819 seconds (7k points/sec against
303k/sec for the defective version — the corrections are roughly 40x more
expensive, mostly retained delisted subscriptions and adjusted bars).

### Root cause, found by counter-review

The submitted peer-length equality did make every residual score unavailable,
so the refusal correctly exposed a real defect. Independent review then found
a deeper issue in the proposed slice fix: the helper summed the most-recent
21 sessions, which are the month a 6-1/12-1 signal must skip. The reviewed
correction uses a fixed 252-session joint market/leave-one-out-industry fit,
then sums residuals over `t-126..t-21` or `t-252..t-21`. All monthly output
from the slice-only implementation is stale pending Claude's counter-review
and a new QC run.

### Limitations and review status

- No statistic exists. Nothing about any alpha can be inferred from this
  entry.
- The slice-only fix was reviewed and corrected again; it must not be run or
  cited. Claude must counter-review the Codex head before a fresh QC run.
- Compile ID was not captured. Later entries record it.

## R-002 — Short battery, B_core and A_large, corrected code (UNANALYSED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | REVERSAL_5D, INDUSTRY_ADJ_REVERSAL_5D, ABNORMAL_VOLUME_REVERSAL, MAX_20, MAX_X_REVERSAL |
| **Replication or new** | Exact replication of the frozen pre-registration, on corrected code |
| **Research look** | Two counted real-market runs; 40 emitted alpha cells total |
| **Source commit** | `e8eb558` (Codex correction), merged via `f4c81dd` |
| **QC project / compile IDs** | not recorded |
| **Backtest IDs** | B_core `a364f6872f6b0827b8adfb22ac20337e`; A_large `6dec09106141c24fbf884738db84c36a` |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Output** | 534 declared dates, 54 base64 blocks each, layout `b64block_date_u32_i32x4_u16x3` |
| **Artifact** | `docs/qc_rr_sht_B_20260816.log` sha256:`a4237e06c00bf6b07fff192a1a4fbd6ab42efe9b6dab0c9b3f6b660a2f8c7f58`; `docs/qc_rr_sht_A_20260816.log` sha256:`f96b076d79729e8906e940f2711cc22b65091ea6d14698cc8b23d8b90e3816b1` |
| **Validity** | **UNANALYSED** — complete output, statistics not yet computed |
| **Provenance** | **PROVENANCE_INCOMPLETE** — project and compile IDs absent |

### The timing correction is confirmed by arithmetic

The invalidated run reported **1,283** non-overlapping five-session
observations over ~3,275 sessions, which implies 2.55 sessions each and is
impossible; the ceiling is 655. The corrected run declares **534**, which
sits just under that ceiling.

This was set as a falsifiable pre-check before the run: if the count came
back near 1,283 the timing fix had not bound and nothing else in the run
would be worth reading. It came back at 534. **QCAR-002 is fixed in
substance, not merely in intent.**

### Why it is UNANALYSED rather than VALID

No statistics have been computed. Contrary to the submitted note,
`scripts/analyse_qc_alpha_battery.py` already contains a reviewed base64-block
decoder and `tests/test_qc_alpha_battery.py` round-trips the exact layout.
Codex deliberately did not run it: analysis belongs after the current code
correction and Claude counter-review so look accounting and result identity
are recorded before any statistic is observed.

A separate process failure was recorded here rather than hidden: my run
queue reported these two runs as `TRUNCATED` because it counts `ROW|`
lines and the corrected short battery emits `B64BLOCK|` lines. The logs are
complete; the checker was wrong. A completeness check that does not
understand the format it is checking gives false alarms in one direction
and would give false assurance in the other.

## R-003 — Monthly battery, A_large (PENDING_REVIEW, not usable)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | Monthly battery, 10 specifications |
| **Research look** | Counted real-market run; 40 emitted alpha cells |
| **Source commit** | `f4c81dd` **plus an uncommitted, unreviewed local fix** to `_residual_momentum` |
| **QC project / compile IDs** | not recorded |
| **Backtest ID** | `df324dbbca4070ac0f45f270406e673a` |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Output** | 142 dates, complete, no INCOMPLETE marker |
| **Artifact** | `docs/qc_rr_mon_A_20260816.log` sha256:`7e161182fb2c0baf711d1b90ebc784301edd80b0edab17fcb5152553c2ca8639` |
| **Validity** | **PENDING_REVIEW — must not be used for any conclusion** |
| **Provenance** | **PROVENANCE_INCOMPLETE** — project and compile IDs absent |

### Why this entry exists at all

**This run should not have happened.** The workflow adopted for this round
is that QuantConnect runs only code that Codex has reviewed and I have
counter-reviewed. My run queue reads the algorithm file at call time, so
when I fixed `_residual_momentum` locally, the queue's next monthly job
silently picked up that unreviewed fix. It emitted 142 complete dates,
which the pre-fix code could not have done — that is how the violation was
detected.

The queue predated the rule, and I did not think through that a running
queue would re-read edited files. The rule is about not using cloud
compute to debug unreviewed code, and that is exactly what happened,
accidentally.

The result is recorded because deleting an inconvenient run is precisely
what this ledger exists to prevent. It is marked unusable, and it will be
superseded by a reviewed rerun rather than promoted.

## R-004 — Universe benchmark, B_core, corrected code (UNANALYSED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Specification** | Equal-weight benchmark of the point-in-time B_core universe |
| **Research look** | Counted real-market benchmark run; not an alpha cell |
| **Source commit** | `e8eb558`, merged via `f4c81dd` |
| **QC project / compile IDs** | not recorded |
| **Backtest ID** | `e3c2ff22333f1c923502b3d1c399fcbb` |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Output** | 155 declared dates, 155 rows, complete |
| **Artifact** | `docs/qc_rr_ben_B_20260816.log` sha256:`ec623810fb53df1021d357a15874595b161ba000fb8614eea49fec3e23021489` |
| **Validity** | **UNANALYSED** — complete, statistics not computed |
| **Provenance** | **PROVENANCE_INCOMPLETE** — project and compile IDs absent |

The corrected benchmark now carries its own delisting arithmetic and cost
treatment (QCAR-008), so it is not comparable to the invalidated
benchmark figures in R-000 and those must not be carried forward.

## R-000 — Superseded battery, all universes (INVALIDATED)

Kept because deleting it would remove the most instructive evidence in
this ledger.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | Monthly battery (10 specs) and short-horizon battery (5 specs), Universes A/B/C |
| **Replication or new** | First execution of the frozen 2026-08-16 pre-registration |
| **Research look** | 135 declared; QCAR-006 finds the true family is 180 |
| **Source commit** | `3a3132e`, `e3e8a23`, `6707a97` |
| **QC project IDs** | monthly 35240692 / 35241425 / 35241487; short 6 windowed projects; benchmark 3 projects |
| **Backtest IDs** | monthly B `238f133c9856464cbed5fb087f10f1e6`; others not recorded — QCAR-010 |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Reported statistics** | `QUALITY_COMPOSITE` A_large IC 0.0355, p ≤ 0.00005 vs gate 0.00037; `INDUSTRY_ADJ_REVERSAL_5D` and `MAX_X_REVERSAL` clearing in all three universes; benchmarks A 0.87 / B 0.92 / C 0.94 Sharpe |
| **Gate outcome** | Three specifications appeared to clear |
| **Validity** | **INVALIDATED** |

### Why it is invalid

Independent review (`docs/REVIEW_2026-08-16_QUANTCONNECT_ALPHA_BATTERY.md`)
found ten P2 defects. Three were verified independently before acceptance:

- **QCAR-002, timing.** 1,283 claimed non-overlapping five-session
  observations in ~3,275 sessions implies 2.55 sessions each; the maximum
  possible is 655. The declared entry lag was absent and holding advanced
  on every `OnData` call. **The impossible count was quoted in the results
  document as evidence of statistical power.**
- **QCAR-001, normalization.** Raw (unadjusted) bars fed the return
  windows, so every split became a fictitious return.
- **QCAR-003, basket construction.** Deciles were formed at settlement
  from names satisfying `s in outcomes`, so anything that stopped trading
  was retroactively dropped — survivorship reintroduced at the portfolio
  level, in work whose premise was fixing survivorship.

Every statistic in that run passed through at least one of these paths.
The passes, the null momentum finding, the MAX-effect interpretation and
the benchmark verdict are all void.

### Kept deliberately

The documents and JSON remain in Git with invalidation banners rather than
being deleted. Two of these defects were mirror images of errors this
project had already written up in other people's work (ABR-001's
unreachable gate, ABR-003's unit mismatch), which is worth more as a
record than as a deleted embarrassment.
