# Alpha result ledger

**Long-lived record of every QuantConnect run.** Rejected, inconclusive,
invalidated, stale and unavailable results are kept here permanently. An
unfavourable result is never deleted and never silently replaced by a
rerun; a rerun is a new entry that references the one it supersedes.

Nothing in this file is trading authorization. QuantConnect is historical
replication only; Alpaca Paper is a later, separate forward-validation
stage.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| VALID | Ran on reviewed code, complete output, statistics usable |
| INVALIDATED | Ran, but a defect found afterwards makes the numbers unusable |
| REFUSED | The algorithm declined to emit results; no statistics exist |
| INCONCLUSIVE | Complete output, but the design cannot answer the question |
| STALE | Superseded by a later run on corrected code |
| UNAVAILABLE | Could not be run |

## R-001 — Monthly battery, Universe B_core, corrected code (REFUSED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | Monthly battery: MOM_3/6/9/12_1, RESIDUAL_MOM_6/12_1, GROSS_PROFITABILITY, QUALITY_COMPOSITE, QUALITY_MOMENTUM, MULTI_ALPHA_COMPOSITE |
| **Replication or new** | Exact replication of the frozen 2026-08-16 pre-registration, on corrected code |
| **Research look** | Not counted — no statistic was produced |
| **Multiplicity family** | QC alpha battery 2026-08-16 (declared 135; Codex QCAR-006 corrects the family to 180) |
| **Source commit** | `e8eb558` (Codex correction), merged via `f4c81dd` |
| **QC project ID** | `35244708` (`tg-rr-mon-B`) |

### What happened

The algorithm refused to emit:

```
INCOMPLETE|missing_specs=MULTI_ALPHA_COMPOSITE|RESIDUAL_MOM_12_1|RESIDUAL_MOM_6_1
```

Codex's completeness guard worked as designed. Rather than emit seven of
ten specifications as though the series were whole — which the previous
generation of this code did, and which produced a headline — it declined
to emit anything.

Universe construction itself was sound and matches the earlier run
exactly: `cap_rows=312696 cap_fallback=35268 cap_missing=7291`. The run
processed 31,958,444 data points in 4,819 seconds (7k points/sec against
303k/sec for the defective version — the corrections are roughly 40x more
expensive, mostly retained delisted subscriptions and adjusted bars).

### Root cause, found by counter-review

`_industry_returns` builds leave-one-out peer series over `count` = 260
sessions. `_residual_momentum` then rejects on
`len(peers) != len(stock)`, where `stock` holds `21 * months` = 126 or 252
returns. **That equality can never hold**, so residual momentum returned
`None` for every name on every date, and `MULTI_ALPHA_COMPOSITE` fell with
it because `RESIDUAL_MOM_12_1` is one of its four legs.

The market leg two lines below is sliced correctly
(`mkt = market[-len(stock):]`); the peer leg was not. Fixed by slicing
peers the same way, with a regression test pinning the arithmetic and one
mutation confirming the test detects a restored equality check.

### Limitations and review status

- No statistic exists. Nothing about any alpha can be inferred from this
  entry.
- The fix is **awaiting Codex review**; it has not been run on
  QuantConnect. Per the workflow, reviewed-then-counter-reviewed code is
  the only code that runs on the cloud.
- Compile ID was not captured. Later entries record it.

## R-002 — Short battery, B_core and A_large, corrected code (UNANALYSED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | REVERSAL_5D, INDUSTRY_ADJ_REVERSAL_5D, ABNORMAL_VOLUME_REVERSAL, MAX_20, MAX_X_REVERSAL |
| **Replication or new** | Exact replication of the frozen pre-registration, on corrected code |
| **Research look** | Not yet counted — no statistic has been computed from these logs |
| **Source commit** | `e8eb558` (Codex correction), merged via `f4c81dd` |
| **QC project / backtest** | B_core `a364f6872f6b0827b8adfb22ac20337e`; A_large `6dec09106141c24fbf884738db84c36a` |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Output** | 534 declared dates, 54 base64 blocks each, layout `b64block_date_u32_i32x4_u16x3` |
| **Artifact** | `docs/qc_rr_sht_B_20260816.log` sha256:a4237e06c00bf6b0; `docs/qc_rr_sht_A_20260816.log` sha256:f96b076d79729e89 |
| **Validity** | **UNANALYSED** — complete output, statistics not yet computed |

### The timing correction is confirmed by arithmetic

The invalidated run reported **1,283** non-overlapping five-session
observations over ~3,275 sessions, which implies 2.55 sessions each and is
impossible; the ceiling is 655. The corrected run declares **534**, which
sits just under that ceiling.

This was set as a falsifiable pre-check before the run: if the count came
back near 1,283 the timing fix had not bound and nothing else in the run
would be worth reading. It came back at 534. **QCAR-002 is fixed in
substance, not merely in intent.**

### Why it is UNANALYSED rather than VALID

No statistics have been computed. The analyser understands the decimal and
scaled-integer layouts but not the new base64 block layout, so reading
these logs requires a decoder that does not yet exist. That work has not
been reviewed and no number is quoted from these runs.

A separate process failure was recorded here rather than hidden: my run
queue reported these two runs as `TRUNCATED` because it counts `ROW|`
lines and the corrected short battery emits `BLOCK|` lines. The logs are
complete; the checker was wrong. A completeness check that does not
understand the format it is checking gives false alarms in one direction
and would give false assurance in the other.

## R-003 — Monthly battery, A_large (PENDING REVIEW, not usable)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | Monthly battery, 10 specifications |
| **Source commit** | `f4c81dd` **plus an uncommitted, unreviewed local fix** to `_residual_momentum` |
| **QC project / backtest** | `df324dbbca4070ac0f45f270406e673a` |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Output** | 142 dates, complete, no INCOMPLETE marker |
| **Artifact** | `docs/qc_rr_mon_A_20260816.log` sha256:7e161182fb2c0baf |
| **Validity** | **PENDING REVIEW — must not be used for any conclusion** |

### Why this entry exists at all

**This run should not have happened.** The workflow adopted for this round
is that QuantConnect runs only code that Codex has reviewed and I have
counter-reviewed. My run queue reads the algorithm file at call time, so
when I fixed `_residual_momentum` locally, the queue's next monthly job
silently picked up that unreviewed fix. It emitted 142 complete dates,
which the pre-fix code could not have done — that is how the violation was
detected.

The queue predated the rule, and I did not think through that a running
queue would re-read edited files. The rule is about not using cloud
compute to debug unreviewed code, and that is exactly what happened,
accidentally.

The result is recorded because deleting an inconvenient run is precisely
what this ledger exists to prevent. It is marked unusable, and it will be
superseded by a reviewed rerun rather than promoted.

## R-004 — Universe benchmark, B_core, corrected code (UNANALYSED)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Specification** | Equal-weight benchmark of the point-in-time B_core universe |
| **Source commit** | `e8eb558`, merged via `f4c81dd` |
| **QC backtest** | `e3c2ff22333f1c923502b3d1c399fcbb` |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Output** | 155 declared dates, 155 rows, complete |
| **Artifact** | `docs/qc_rr_ben_B_20260816.log` sha256:ec623810fb53df10 |
| **Validity** | **UNANALYSED** — complete, statistics not computed |

The corrected benchmark now carries its own delisting arithmetic and cost
treatment (QCAR-008), so it is not comparable to the invalidated
benchmark figures in R-000 and those must not be carried forward.

## R-000 — Superseded battery, all universes (INVALIDATED)

Kept because deleting it would remove the most instructive evidence in
this ledger.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Alpha / specification** | Monthly battery (10 specs) and short-horizon battery (5 specs), Universes A/B/C |
| **Replication or new** | First execution of the frozen 2026-08-16 pre-registration |
| **Research look** | 135 declared; QCAR-006 finds the true family is 180 |
| **Source commit** | `3a3132e`, `e3e8a23`, `6707a97` |
| **QC project IDs** | monthly 35240692 / 35241425 / 35241487; short 6 windowed projects; benchmark 3 projects |
| **Backtest IDs** | monthly B `238f133c9856464cbed5fb087f10f1e6`; others not recorded — QCAR-010 |
| **Data period** | 2012-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| **Reported statistics** | `QUALITY_COMPOSITE` A_large IC 0.0355, p ≤ 0.00005 vs gate 0.00037; `INDUSTRY_ADJ_REVERSAL_5D` and `MAX_X_REVERSAL` clearing in all three universes; benchmarks A 0.87 / B 0.92 / C 0.94 Sharpe |
| **Gate outcome** | Three specifications appeared to clear |
| **Validity** | **INVALIDATED** |

### Why it is invalid

Independent review (`docs/REVIEW_2026-08-16_QUANTCONNECT_ALPHA_BATTERY.md`)
found ten P2 defects. Three were verified independently before acceptance:

- **QCAR-002, timing.** 1,283 claimed non-overlapping five-session
  observations in ~3,275 sessions implies 2.55 sessions each; the maximum
  possible is 655. The declared entry lag was absent and holding advanced
  on every `OnData` call. **The impossible count was quoted in the results
  document as evidence of statistical power.**
- **QCAR-001, normalization.** Raw (unadjusted) bars fed the return
  windows, so every split became a fictitious return.
- **QCAR-003, basket construction.** Deciles were formed at settlement
  from names satisfying `s in outcomes`, so anything that stopped trading
  was retroactively dropped — survivorship reintroduced at the portfolio
  level, in work whose premise was fixing survivorship.

Every statistic in that run passed through at least one of these paths.
The passes, the null momentum finding, the MAX-effect interpretation and
the benchmark verdict are all void.

### Kept deliberately

The documents and JSON remain in Git with invalidation banners rather than
being deleted. Two of these defects were mirror images of errors this
project had already written up in other people's work (ABR-001's
unreachable gate, ABR-003's unit mismatch), which is worth more as a
record than as a deleted embarrassment.
