"""Current-state documents must not retain known contradictory status claims.

CCX-002. The first version of this guard asserted the CURRENT epoch by name
(`paper-epoch-002` has been active since 2026-08-06). That inverts what a
consistency test is for: rolling to epoch-003 is a legitimate, expected event
that would have failed the suite, and the obvious fix would have been to edit
the assertion -- so the guard would have enforced today's state rather than
preventing contradiction, and would have been "fixed" by weakening every time
reality moved.

What is durable is the *relationship* between documents, not the values:

* the active plan must not simultaneously call an epoch active and closed;
* a document must not describe as unbuilt something another current section
  records as complete; and
* the sweep record must carry exactly one finding count and status.

Those hold whatever the epoch number is. Where a literal string is
unavoidable, it is a phrase that should never be true again (a known-stale
claim), never one that must stay true.
